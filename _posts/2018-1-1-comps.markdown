Worked directly with clients to design and launch a mobile application on an accelerated timeline.
The mobile app tracks which activities from the Wellness Challenge students have completed and sends reminders for future activities.
Collaborated with a team of 6 to develop the app using React Native. 
Acted as a product owner for the team; tracked tasks using Trello, ran team meetings, and set software design patterns across the app. 
Received a grade of distinction from faculty members for leadership and development expertise.
