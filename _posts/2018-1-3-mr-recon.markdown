Member of the Edison Engineering Development Program (EEDP), which is a technical leadership program within GE. Exposed
the C++ MR image reconstruction pipeline via a Python SDK using Boost to enable neural network development with
Tensorflow. Created APIs in C++, Matlab, and Python to access raw data from an MR scan file rather than the fully
reconstructed image.
